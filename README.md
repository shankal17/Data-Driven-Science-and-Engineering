# Data-Driven-Science-and-Engineering
These are the examples and problem sets to Steve Brunton's and Nathan Kutz's book "Data-Driven Science and Engineering: Machine Learning, Dynamical Systems, and Control".
All of the code and unsolved problem sets can be found on their book website [here](http://www.databookuw.com/).The problem set solutions are my own work.
